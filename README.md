This project is a base to work on BM64 module from Microchip
to understand it's applications (Single-speaker, multi-speaker, ...)

At this state, we can control BM64 to wake up, add pairing in single-speaker mod
and pairing in multi-speaker mod. The main goal of this project is supposed to
create an embedded stereo bluetooth speaker (connected to each one).
